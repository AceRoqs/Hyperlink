This is a basic Hyperlink Win32 control.  It is a suitable control
for all Win32 systems, especially those which pre-date the built-in
common control.

In terms of dependencies, it relies on straight Win32 calls without
a dependency on MFC, ATL, or other frameworks.  It is standalone,
in that it doesn't subclass any Win32 controls.  It does take a soft
dependency on IDC_HAND, which was introducted in Windows 2000, as
well as COLOR_HOTLIGHT.

Given that the control is lightweight, it doesn't have support for
IME, RTL text, tooltips, parent notifications, or drag and drop.
It does have basic support for proper coloring, underlining,
hovering, and focus.

Direct access to the control class shouldn't be necessary, as the
control should be created either through CreateWindowEx or through
a .RC file.  Therefore, very little is exposed through the header
file.  register_hyperlink_class(), defined in hyperlink.h, is
exposed to register the window class itself.  The TestApp folder
is a simple application which demonstrates this.

The code is a rather modern C++ interpretation of pure Win32 code,
albiet without RAII for the GDI objects, which would have been
helpful.  With that in mind, it does require a compiler, such as
Visual C++ 2010, which has C++0x support (particularly unique_ptr).

Stylisticly, the code is based on the JSF coding standards.  I
chose this as a reasonable bridge of styles between traditional
Windows coding and such modern C++ styles as used in Boost.
